### Introduction to package, chip, pads, core, die and IPs
This section explains about various terminology used in ASIC chip design. 

Let us consider Arduino board which is basic embedded toolkit used for embedded programming. This arduino board has a processor chip which contains multiple interfaces for various applications. 
Package refers to housing where integrated circuit is placed.
Chip is placed usually at centre of package where leads of package are connected  through thin wires.
Pads are placed to send or received signals from or to leads of package and core.
Core refers to actual circuit designed with particular components and technology process which handles the logic.
Die is base of chip on which entire integrated circuit is built and cut out off wafer.
IPs are kind of blackbox where functionality of circuit is known and not design. We usually use IPs where we reuse of existing code in the form of IPs.
